# INTERNSHIPS PROJECTS

1. House Price Prediction
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on several features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns like 'sqft_above'.
Handling of missing data is conducted, although further details will depend on the actual cleaning steps.
A date feature transformation was applied where dates were converted into a binary form.
Modeling Approach:
The target variable y is defined as the house price.
The project uses Linear Regression as the primary model for prediction.
Train-test split is performed to create training and testing datasets.
Metrics:
The model's performance is evaluated using RÂ² score to measure the goodness of fit.
Visualization techniques such as matplotlib and seaborn are used to display relationships in the dataset.
This project focuses on a basic regression approach for house price prediction, employing common techniques in data cleaning and model evaluation.

2. Location-Based Analytics
Objective: This notebook appears to focus on analyzing data related to geographical locations, possibly for market analysis or understanding demographic patterns.
Tools and Libraries:
GeoPandas is used for geographic data manipulation.
Data visualization is done through matplotlib.
Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and the first few rows are inspected.
Further steps like geographical mapping and spatial analysis are likely based on the subsequent code.
Geospatial Analysis:
The use of GeoPandas suggests that this project might involve mapping, spatial relationships, and perhaps distance-based clustering or other forms of location-based data mining.
Visualization:
There is a strong focus on visualizing spatial data to extract insights.
This project appears to emphasize geographic data analysis, potentially useful for applications such as location-based marketing, service optimization, or urban planning.

3. Restaurant Ratings Prediction
Objective: The task is to predict restaurant ratings based on various features such as restaurant type, location, and other customer or business attributes.
Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and inspected with a focus on understanding the features.
Data visualization techniques like Seaborn are used to explore the relationships between features.
Modeling Approach:
Although the model is not explicitly mentioned in the first few cells, it likely involves regression models (e.g., Linear Regression) or classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict the ratings.
Visualization:
The project likely uses scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts to uncover trends in the restaurant data and assist with model diagnostics.
This project aims to forecast restaurant ratings, which could help businesses and consumers by identifying key factors driving customer satisfaction.
